Introduction :
"ChipNet: Optimizing Network-on-Chip Performance" is all about making computer chips run smoother and faster. Inside a chip, there are tiny roads called "Network-on-Chip" that help different parts of the chip talk to each other. Our project focuses on making these roads work better.

We do this by pretending to have a chip on a computer and seeing how well it works using a special simulation. We check things like how quickly messages can move along these roads and how much data can be sent at once. Then, we use a clever trick called "Proximal Policy Optimization" to adjust the settings and improve these roads even more.

In simple terms, our project is about making sure that the communication between different parts of a computer chip is super efficient. This can help make computers run faster and smoother overall.

Problem Statement :
The problem statement outlines the requirements for designing an optimal NOC system capable of meeting specified performance criteria, including latency, bandwidth, buffer sizing, and throttling.

Solution Approach :
The solution utilizes a pseudocode algorithm to process monitor output from the NOC simulation, calculating average latency and bandwidth. Additionally, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is incorporated to optimize policy settings and enhance NOC performance iteratively.

Future Improvements:
Incorporate more sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques for enhanced optimization.
Implement visualization tools for better analysis of NOC performance.
Expand simulation capabilities to handle more complex scenarios and workloads.
